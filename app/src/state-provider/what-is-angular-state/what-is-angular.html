    <h2 class="content-subhead">What Is AngularJS</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms, it is a web application framework that follows the MVC design patter. For those of you who don't know MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. AngularJS is a 100% JavaScript and is compatible with both your desktop and mobile browsers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Model: Responsible for maintaining the application data, a model in AngularJS can be a range of data types in JavaScript such as a string, number, boolean, or just a plain javascript object. ($scope)</li>
      <li> View: Is pretty self explanatory, it is what the user sees. AngularJS uses HTML as its templating language and even allows you to create your own elements by using directives. </li>
      <li> Controller: It is where all the magic happens, it is the place where we put our applications logic. Our model lives within our controllers in AngularJS. The controller is what controls the Model and the View based on the User interactions. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="content-subhead">Framework Vs. Library</h2>
