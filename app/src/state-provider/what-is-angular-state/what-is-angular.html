    <p>
       Developed by Google in 2009. It is simply JavaScript, which makes it easily compatible with your desktop and mobile browsers. It is a web application framework that follows the MVVM design pattern. Depending on the devloper, it can also be considered a MVC pattern. For those of you who don't know, MVVM stands for Model-View-View-Model.

    <ul>
      <li> Model: Responsible for maintaining the application data, a model in AngularJS is what allows your application to share state or attach data within your controllers.</li>
      <li> View: It is what the user sees. AngularJS uses HTML as its templating language. View is bound to your $scope. Displays the data based what is supplied by the controller. </li>
      <li> View Model: It is the place where we put our applications logic. Our application model lives within our controllers in AngularJS. The model view is what connects our model and view by controlling the state of the view and manipulating the model based on user interactions. </li>
    </ul>
