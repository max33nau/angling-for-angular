     In angular.js.min there is global
    angular object and inside that object is a module.
    That module takes the name of your app and takes a
    array of dependencies.

     What is dependency injection?

    Giving a function a object, rather than creating a object
    inside a function we pass it into the function

    $scope is big complex object that comes from
    dependency injection.
     All angularJS services start with a $ sign.
     We can now add on to the $scope object

    .controllers take a name and a function

    Variables stored on the $scope object are known as the model
