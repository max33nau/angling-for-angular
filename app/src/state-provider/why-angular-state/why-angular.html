    <h2 class="content-subhead">Why Choose AngularJS?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Reusability: the ability to create custom components through directives such as a main-nav or a login-form allows you to reuse these throughout your projects</li>
      <li> Already embraces things that we already know such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript </li>
      <li> Two-way data binding along with a lot of built in directives that solve issues we have been banging our head over using jQuery. </li>
      <li> Simple dependency injection allowing the user to use other directives, services, and factories such as a router provider or animation services. </li>
      <li> Built with testability in mind such as E2E and Unit Testing </li>
      <li> Great for building small single page Apps </li>
      <li> Easy to learn </li>
      <li> Job opportunities won't disapear once Angular 2 comes out. A lot of companies are currently using version 1 and we still don't know when Angular 2 is even going to be released. </li>
